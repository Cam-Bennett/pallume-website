The job I had gotten good at suddenly required more of everything — more communication, more administrative work, more leadership, more oversight. On top of that, I had goals I wanted to drive for the office in addition to managing the day-to-day.",

    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "The gap between how hard I was working and what I was actually producing started to widen. I'd end a day exhausted and look back at it trying to identify what I'd actually moved forward. Most days, I couldn't point to much. I was responding to everyone, available to do everything, and directing nothing.",

      text: "I started studying productivity — YouTube, books, interviews with people who had figured this out. It was through this search that I discovered a concept that reframed everything for me: context switching is not a minor inconvenience. It is a productivity killer so consistent and so invisible that most people never identify it as the actual problem.",

      text: "I tried notebooks. Notes on my desk. A desk calendar. A digital calendar. At one point, multiple digital calendars simultaneously. I tried task-tracking apps. I read books. I used ChatGPT without any structure and got some decent answers, but had no way to keep track of what I was doing.",

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Here's a simple example of a nagging shortfall: for years, our office tried to send one email per month to our client list. One per month. We couldn't do it consistently. There was no system behind it, so it kept falling apart. After I built my system, I went to six to eight emails per month — a comprehensive market update and a weekly blog post I write myself. Same person. Completely different output. The only variable was the system.",

Another day I evaluate what I'm giving time to that doesn't deserve it, and decide what to replace it with. These themes keep the check-in from becoming routine in the wrong way.",

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "The AI does all of these things — not because it's smarter than you, but because it has no ego, no agenda, and no blind spots about your patterns. It sees what you've told it across thirty days of entries and tells you what it observes. That feedback lands differently than feedback from another person. One of my clients texted me in her first week: \"Why is it so much easier to take criticism from Claude than from another person?\"",

      type: "paragraph",

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "And then there's the coach layer. I read each client's weekly summary. I identify what the AI surfaced, what it missed, and what the system needs to handle better. That combination — AI pattern recognition plus human interpretation — is what no app replicates on its own.",

A configuration built from a deep-dive interview about how they actually work — their energy patterns, their failure modes, their goals, their values, the specific ways they get stuck.",

    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Two clients can come in with identical-sounding problems and leave with completely different systems. Because they're different people. A system that works for one will fail the other at exactly the point where those people diverge.",
