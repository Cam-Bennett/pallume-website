    heading: "2. Eligibility and Acceptance",
    paragraphs: [
      "Pallume is not an open enrollment service. Access requires completing an application, a discovery conversation with Camden Bennett, and mutual agreement to proceed. Submission of an application does not constitute acceptance. Camden Bennett reserves the right to decline any application without explanation.",
      "By engaging Pallume services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old, have the legal authority to enter into this agreement, and are a business owner or operator with an active working context the system can address.",

    heading: "3. Payment",

    heading: "4. Cancellation",
    paragraphs: [
      "You may cancel a monthly engagement with 30 days written notice to camden@pallume.com. No partial refunds are issued for the current billing period. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the paid period.",
      "Path C project engagements are governed by the scope document agreed upon at project start. Cancellation of a project engagement mid-delivery does not entitle the client to a refund of amounts already paid.",

System configurations created for you during your engagement are yours to use. You may not resell, sublicense, or distribute them as a service to others.",
